    <div class="text">
      <span>The conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians reflects a long-standing struggle in the region
        encompassing the land between the Jordan River to the east and the Mediterranean Sea to the west. That conflict
        has deep historical roots, shaped by statehood claims from the Israelis and the Palestinians that have been
        supported by various international agendas and activities over time.

        The Israeli-Palestinian conflict dates back more than a century, with flashpoints building from the United
        Nations 1947 initial UN Partition Plan to the 1973 Yom Kippur War, to the recent Israel-Hamas war sparked in
        October 2023.

        Despite continued efforts at brokering peace—including the 1979 Camp David Accords, the Oslo Accords of the
        1990s, and the 2020 Abraham Accords—conflict has persisted.

        This timeline explores some of the pivotal moments in the conflict from 1947 to today.</span>

            two states, one Jewish and one Arab. The resolution also envisions an international, UN-run body to
            administer Jerusalem. The Palestinian territories had been under the military and administrative control of
            the United Kingdom (known as a mandate) since the 1917 defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I. Civil

      <p>The Palestinians are a people with a long history and deep roots in their land and traditions. For thousands of
        years, Palestine has been a focal point of major historical events. Palestine belongs to the famed Fertile
        Crescent of human antiquity, home to some of the first agricultural communities in the world.</p>

          <p>“I decided to go back to the farming methods of my ancestors and opened my own organic farm. Safe organic
            farming is all about the proper management of water, using compost, and most of all, treating the soil as a
            living organism. With my strawberries, I am trying to bring back the old days and underscore the need to
            alter the farming culture here away from fertilizers. Every farmer should make the decision to organically
            farm.”- Ayman, farmer (Beit Lahia, Gaza)</p>

      <p>In the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, many Palestinians are refugees from villages, towns and cities that
        became Israel. Some of these displaced live in refugee camps, while others live in towns and cities across the
        Palestinian territories. Within present-day Israel, the largest Palestinian populations are in Galilee in the
        north, particularly the city of Nazareth, and in East Jerusalem.</p>

      <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Although most Palestinians traditionally lived in villages with large extended
        families in close proximity, in
        urban areas Palestinians live in smaller family homes. However, even in cities it remains a very family-oriented
        culture. Extended family gatherings with meals are common — many families may participate in such get-togethers
        every week. Grandparents traditionally live with the family of the eldest son.

        Extended family networks offer Palestinian families the social safety net that is not provided by governments.
        Whether helping a student with tuition, ensuring a relative is well-cared for in retirement, or supporting a
        family member who is unemployed, facing medical expenses, or living with disabilities, extended families are the
        backbone of Palestinian welfare. Often Palestinians in the diaspora send vital financial support for family
        members back in Palestine.</p>

      <p>Many regions of Palestine have distinctive arts and crafts for which they are well known. Olive-wood carving,
        for instance, is closely associated with Bethlehem, where artisans can sell to the religious tourists the area
        has long attracted. Nablus, meanwhile, is traditionally famous for its soap production, while Hebron is renowned
        for glass blowing and ceramics. And Gaza City is known for the production of pottery and rugs.</p>
